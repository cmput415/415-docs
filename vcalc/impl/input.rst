Input
=====

The input processed by your compiler will be in a file specified on the
command line. Your compiler will be invoked with the following command:

::

     vcalc <input_file_path> <output_file_path>

You should open the file ``input_file_path`` and parse it. The input
file will be a valid vcalc file.
