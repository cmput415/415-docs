Deliverables
============

Your submission will be **the latest commit before the deadline** to
your github repository. Your submission will be automatically
snapshotted by the GitHub classroom at the submission time.

Do no submit your binaries, they will be built just before being tested.
The solutions will be built using the lab machines. You should make sure
your solution builds in a lab environment prior to the submission time.

Your tests also should be committed to your github repository. We will
pull both your submission and tests directly from your repository.

You do not need to submit anything on eclass or anywhere else.
