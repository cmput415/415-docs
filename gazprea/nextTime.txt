Should multi-step implicit promotion be allowed?
  - e.g. `[2.4, 3.6] * 5`
How should string concatenation with a character work?
  - e.g. `"abcd" || 'e'`
  - Disallowed, clarify that `||` only works between `string` and `character[*]`
  - As an append, resulting in `"abcde"`
  - As a splat and concatenate, resulting in `"abcdeeee"`
Should we allow casting of `null` and `identity`?
  - e.g. `as<real>(null)`
Should we change to type and other symbols in a shared scope tree or remain with non-conflicting resolution paths.
  - e.g.
    ```
      typedef integer a;
      const integer a = 0; // Redefinition of symbol `a` or legal?
    ```
How should we refer to functions and procedures collectively when something applies to both?
  - Routine
  - Subroutine

How should we approach rewinding whitespace?
  - Don't.
  - Limit buffer.
  - Run-length encoding.
