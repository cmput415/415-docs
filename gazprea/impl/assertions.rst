Assertions
==========

**ALL** input test cases will be valid. It can be a good idea to do
error checking for your own testing and debugging, but it is *not
necessary*. If you encounter what you think is undefined behaviour or
think something is ambiguous then *do* make a forum post about it to
clarify.

What does it mean to be valid input? The input must adhere to the
specification. The rules below give more in-depth explanation of
specification particulars.

#. 

   .. _assert:opened-comments:

   .. container::
      :name: opened_comments

      **opened-comments**:

   Block comments will be opened. Not opening a block comment will cause
   ANTLR to encounter a lost ``*/`` as well as causing a stream of word
   tokens starting from where the ``/*`` token should be. For example,
   the following tests would be considered invalid:

   ::

            integer i = 0;
            I'm a closed comment, but I'm never opened... */
            integer j = i + 1;

#. 

   .. _assert:closed-comments:

   .. container::
      :name: closed-comments

      **closed-comments**:

   Block comments will be closed. Not closing a block comment will have
   ANTLR consume every token in the file, rendering the rest of the file
   useless. For example, the following tests would be considered
   invalid:

   ::

            integer i = 0;
            /* I'm an opened comment, but I'm never closed...
            integer j = i + 1;

#. 

   .. _assert:assign-streams:

   .. container::
      :name: assign-streams

      **assign-streams**:

   The streams constructors ``std\_output()`` and ``std\_input()`` *will
   not* be used in expressions. They must be assigned before use so that
   ``stream\_state`` can be checked later. For example, the following
   tests would be considered invalid:

   ::

            'a' -> std_output();
            character b;
            b <- std_input();

#. 

   .. _assert:const-arg:

   .. container::
      :name: const-arg

      **const-arg**:

   Procedure ``var`` arguments will not be passed ``const`` values. A
   ``var`` argument implies the value is mutable in the calling context,
   which a ``const`` value is not. See :ref:`sec:procedure` for more information. For
   example, the following tests would be considered invalid:

   ::

            procedure f(var integer i) {
              i = 1;
            }

            procedure main() returns integer {
              const integer i = 0;
              call f(i);
              return 0;
            }

#. 

   .. _assert:qualifier-init:

   .. container::
      :name: qualifier-init

      **qualifier-init**:

   Declarations using only qualifiers will be immediately initialised.
   If they were not, it would be impossible to infer their type, a
   necessary piece of information for use later in the AST. For example,
   the following tests would be considered invalid:

   ::

            var i;
            const i;

#. 

   .. _assert:safe-reals:

   .. container::
      :name: safe-reals

      **safe-reals**:

   No floating point operation will create a runtime error. This is a
   manifestation of the inability to standardise exception handling, not
   an extension to the spec forcing you to somehow fix floating point
   exceptions.

#. 

   .. _assert:tuple-min-fields:

   .. container::
      :name: tuple-min-fields

      **tuple-min-fields**:

   A ``tuple`` will have at least two internal types. Storing one type
   would be equivalent to storing just the value and the ``tuple`` would
   be a useless wrapper. Storing zero types would be an undefined
   behaviour with operations on an empty space. For example, the
   following tests would be considered invalid:

   ::

            tuple(int);
            tuple();

#. 

   .. _assert:exact-tuple-types:

   .. container::
      :name: exact-tuple-types

      **exact-tuple-types**:

   The exact size of the internal types of a ``tuple`` will be
   inferrable at compile time. For example, these are invalid:

   ::

            tuple(integer[*], int) t1;
            tuple(string, real) t2;
            var t3;

#. 

   .. _assert:tuple-literal-dot:

   .. container::
      :name: tuple-literal-dot

      **tuple-literal-dot**:

   Dot notation cannot be applied to ``tuple`` literals. A ``tuple``
   literal, to be well formed, must have all of its valueâ€™s types known
   at compile time (:ref:`exact-tuple-types <assert:exact-tuple-types>`) which is
   only possible if all of the values are known at compile time. If the
   value to be indexed to is known at compile time then there is no need
   to create the ``tuple``, index the single field, and finally discard
   the extra values. For example, the following tests would be
   considered invalid:

   ::

            integer i = ('a', 1, 3.14).2;
