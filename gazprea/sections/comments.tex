\textit{Gazprea} supports \textit{C99} style comments.

Single line comments are made using \code{//}. Anything on the line after the two adjacent forward
slashes is ignored. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
	integer x = 2 * 3;  // This is ignored
\end{lstlisting}

Multi-line block comments are made using \textbf{/*} and \textbf{*/}. The start of a block comment
is marked using \textbf{/*}, and the end of the block comment is the \textbf{first} occurrence of
the sequence of characters \textbf{*/}. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
	/* This is a block comment. I can span as many lines as we want, and
	   only ends when the closing sequence is encountered.
	 */
	integer x = 2 * 3;  /* Block comments can also be on a single line */
\end{lstlisting}

\assertion{Block comments will be opened.}{opened-comments}\\
\assertion{Block comments will be closed.}{closed-comments}

Block comments cannot be nested because the comment finishes when it reaches the first closing
sequence. For example, this is invalid:
\begin{lstlisting}
  /* A comment /* A nested comment */ */
\end{lstlisting}
