Type Promotion
==============

Type promotion is a sub-problem of casting and refers to casts that happen
implicitly.

Any conversion that can be done implicitly via promotion can also be done
explicitly via typecast expression.
The notable exception is array promotion to a higher dimension, which occurs as
a consequence of scalar to array promotion.

Scalars
-------

The only automatic type promotion for scalars is ``integer`` to
``real``. This promotion is one way - a ``real`` cannot be automatically
converted to ``integer``.

Automatic type conversion follows this table where N/A means no implicit
conversion possible, id means no conversion necessary,
``as<toType>(var)`` means var of type "From type" is converted to type
"toType" using semantics from .

Scalar to Array
--------------------------

All scalar types can be promoted to arrays that have an internal type that the
scalar can be :ref:`converted to implicity <ssec:typePromotion_scalar>`.
This can occur when an array is used in an operation with a scalar value.

The scalar will be implicitly converted to an array of
equivalent dimensions and equivalent internal type. For example:

::

     integer i = 1;
     integer[*] v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     integer[*] res = v + i;

     res -> std_output;

would print the following:

::

     [2 3 4 5 6]

Other examples:

::

  1 == [1, 1]  // True
  1..2 || 3 // [1, 2, 3]

Note that an array can never be downcast to a scalar,
even if type casting is used. Also note that matrix multiply imposes strict
requirements on the dimensionality of the the operands. The consequence is
that scalars can only be promoted to a matrix if the matrix multiply
operand is a square matrix (:math:`m \times m`).

Tuple to Tuple
--------------

Tuples may be promoted to another tuple type if it has an equal number of
internal types and the original internal types can be implicitly
converted to the new internal types. For example:

::

     tuple(integer, integer) int_tup = (1, 2);
     tuple(real, real) real_tup = int_tup;

     tuple(char, integer, boolean[2]) many_tup = ('a', 1, [true, false]);
     tuple(char, real, boolean[2]) other_tup = many_tup;

Field names of tuples are overwritten by the field names of the left-hand side
in assignments and declarations when promoted. For example:

::

     tuple(integer, real) foo = (1, 2);
     tuple(real, real) bar = foo;

     foo.1 -> std_output; // 1
     foo.2 -> std_output; // 2

     bar.1 -> std_output; // error
     bar.2 -> std_output; // error
     bar.3 -> std_output; // 1


If initializing a variable with a tuple via :ref:`sec:typeInference`, the
variable is assumed to be the same type.
Therefore, field names are also copied over accordingly. For example:

::

     tuple(real, real) foo = (1, 2);
     tuple(real, real) bar = (3, 4);

     var baz = foo;
     baz.1 -> std_output; // 1
     baz.2 -> std_output; // 2

     baz = bar;
     baz.1 -> std_output; // 3
     baz.2 -> std_output; // 4


It is possible for a two sided promotion to occur with tuples. For example:

::

  boolean b = (1.0, 2) == (2, 3.0);

Character Array to/from String
-------------------------------

A ``string`` can be implicitly converted to an array of ``character``\ s and vice-versa (two-way type promotion).

::

     string str1 = "Hello"; /* str1 == "Hello" */
     character[*] chars = str1; /* chars == ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'] */
     string str2 = chars || [' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']; /* str2 == "Hello World" */
