Identifiers
===========

Identifiers in *Gazprea* must start with either an underscore or a
letter (upper or lower cased). Subsequent characters can be an
underscore, letter (upper or lower case), or number. An identifier may
not be any of *Gazprea*\ â€™s keywords. Here are some valid identifiers in
*Gazprea*:

::

   	hello
   	h3ll0
   	_h3LL0
   	_Hi
   	Hi
   	_3

The following are some examples of invalid identifiers. They begin with
a number, contain invalid characters, or are a keyword:

::

   	3d
   	in
   	a-bad-variable-name
   	no@twitter
   	we.don't.like.punctuation

*Gazprea* imposes no restrictions on the length of identifiers.
