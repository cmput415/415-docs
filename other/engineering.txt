Weekly meetings:
  - Styles:
    - Scrum/standup:
      - Appoint a scrum leader who ensures people follow scrum rules
    - Classic:
      - Appoint a meeting chair who will direct the meeting according to the
        agenda and accept actions
  - At least one larger group meeting (progress)
    - Should be "longer"
    - Meeting notes must be taken and committed
      - These will be reviewed/marked
      - See given format
  - At least one other meeting (check-in)
    - should be "shorter"
    - report blockers, request help, discuss issues
    - Does not need to be recorded
  - Other meetings are optional

Meeting Date/Time start/end:
 19/08/2020 1:30 PM
 19/08/2020 2:30 PM
Attendees:
  Nelson
  Braedy
  Deric
Late arrivals (Person (time)):
  - Braedy (1:45 PM)
Early departures (Person (time)):
  - Deric (2:20 PM)
Discussion items/agenda:
  - Memory allocator memory leak.
  - Missing documentation on type inference functions.
Details:
  - The memory allocator leaks memory when resizing vectors during addition
    operations.
  - Complicated functionality in the type promotion for different scalar types
    in vectors is missing documentation.
Actions:
  - Nelson volunteers to address the memory allocator leak.
  - Braedy promises to be better about documentation in the future and will
    return to these functions to add documentation today.
    - Deric will verify it is complete.
Round table:
  - Deric:
    - Will continue working on matrix multiplication in grammar and AST.
  - Nelson:
    - Completed I/O runtime functions last week.
    - Working on matrix multiplication runtime functions this week.
  - Braedy:
    - Completed integer arithmetic lowering to IR.
    - Started and will continue to work on float arithmetic.
    - Stretch goal for next week: integer to float promotion.
