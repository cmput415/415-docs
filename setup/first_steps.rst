First Steps
===========

JetBrains License
-----------------

You need a valid JetBrains account to use CLion. Luckily, you're a
student and that gets you free things. If you already have an account
with a student license, you can skip this.

#. Fill out `this form <https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students>`__ to
   start getting your student license. Select ``I'm a student`` then fill out
   the rest of the form appropriately. **You must use your ualberta email
   address to be approved.** If your email address is rejected, click the
   ``Official Document`` link and fill out that form instead. You should still
   use your ualberta email address. Use a photo of your ONEcard as your official
   document.

#. Go to your ualberta email inbox (the automation process is typically quite
   quick), find an email from JetBrains, and follow the instructions to create
   an account.

#. You should be able to use CLion with your account now.
