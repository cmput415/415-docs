First Steps
===========

JetBrains License
-----------------

You need a valid JetBrains account to use CLion. Luckily, you’re a
student and that gets you free things. If you already have an account
with a student license, you can skip this.

#. Fill out `this
   form <https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students>`__ to start
   getting your student license. Select ``I’m a student``, enter your
   first and last name, enter your **UAlberta email address**, select
   ``Canada``, and finally agree to the account agreement.

#. Go to your email inbox, find the email with the subject
   ``JetBrains Educational Pack Confirmation``. Open it and click the
   link ``Confirm Request``.

#. You should see a new page with the header
   ``Congrats! You’ve been approved!``.

#. There should be a new email in your inbox with the subject
   ``JetBrains Student License Confirmation``. Open it and click the
   link ``Activate Educational License``.

#. Fill out the form to create your account. Enter your first name, last
   name, and username. Choose an appropriate password and accept the
   account agreement. It’s your choice to consent to the use of your
   data, but it’s not necessary.

#. Your account should be usable with CLion now.
