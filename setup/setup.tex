These instructions are for setting up your development environment for CMPUT 415. There are
different instructions for Ubuntu (Should be applicable for most linux systems), Mac, and Windows
environments.

\section{First Steps}
\subsection{JetBrains License}
You need a valid JetBrains account to use CLion. Luckily, you're a student and that gets you
free things. If you already have an account with a student license, you can skip this.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Fill out \href{https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students} {this form} to start getting
    your student license. Select \texttt{I'm a student}, enter your first and last name, enter
    your \textbf{UAlberta email address}, select \texttt{Canada}, and finally agree to the
    account agreement.
  \item
    Go to your email inbox, find the email with the subject \texttt{JetBrains Educational Pack
    Confirmation}. Open it and click the link \texttt{Confirm Request}.
  \item
    You should see a new page with the header \texttt{Congrats! You've been approved!}.
  \item
    There should be a new email in your inbox with the subject \texttt{JetBrains Student License
    Confirmation}. Open it and click the link \texttt{Activate Educational License}.
  \item
    Fill out the form to create your account. Enter your first name, last name, and username.
    Choose an appropriate password and accept the account agreement. It's your choice to
    consent to the use of your data, but it's not necessary.
  \item
    Your account should be usable with CLion now.
\end{enumerate}
