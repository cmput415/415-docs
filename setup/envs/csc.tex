		If you're working on the computers on the CS network then most of the installation is already done for you. However, some steps are needed for the final setup to work properly. To simplify
		the execution of these steps we have created a script to do most of the work. Download the script \href{static/setup_antlr.sh}{here} and
		then run it.

	\subsection{Configuring first project}
