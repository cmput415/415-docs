# Building

## Required software:
	- texlive
	- htlatex

The Makefile builds the html and pdf file and moves the files into to a sub
directory.  To use the Makefile make sure that it is in the same diractory as
the source file. In the makefile there are options on the top. SRC needs to be
set to The name of the file that contains the source code. DO NOT INCLUDE THE
file extension. CSS can be set to the additional css rule you want to add to
the generated css code.

## Use:
	`make all`	- to build html and pdf files
	`make html` - to build html files only
	`make pdf`	- to build pdf files only
	`make clean`- to clean up all generated files
