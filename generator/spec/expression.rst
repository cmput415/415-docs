Expression
==========

An expression is composed of integers, identifiers, and integer
mathematical operations.

Operators
---------

============== ========== =============== =================
**Operation**  **Symbol** **Usage**       **Associativity**
============== ========== =============== =================
exponentiation ^          ``expr ^Â expr`` right
multiplication \*         ``expr * expr`` left
division       /          ``expr / expr`` left
remainder      %          ``expr % expr`` left
addition       \+         ``expr + expr`` left
subtraction    \-         ``expr - expr`` left
============== ========== =============== =================

| **Assertion:** All exponents are :math:`\geq 0`.
  (:ref:`nonnegative-exp <assert:nonnegative-exp>`)
| **Clarification:** The ``%`` operator is remainder not modulus.
  (:ref:`rem-not-mod <clarify:rem-not-mod>`)
| **Clarification:** Division is integer division.
  (:ref:`int-div <clarify:int-div>`)

Valid Expressions
-----------------

Valid formats for expressions are

::

     (<expr>)
     <expr> <op> <expr>
     <int>
     <id>

-  ``expr`` is an expression.

-  ``int`` is an integer.

-  ``id`` is the identifier of a variable.

| **Assertion:** All expressions will result in a value that fits in a
  32 bit signed integer. (:ref:`expression-size <assert:expression-size>`)
| **Assertion:** No expression will contain a division by 0.
  (:ref:`zero-divide <assert:zero-divide>`)

Examples of valid expressions are

::

     i * 2 * 10 + 4
     2 ^ 4 * 5

Precedence
----------

Precedence determines what order operations are evaluated in. Precedence
works as defined in the following table:

============== ==============
**Precedence** **Operations**
============== ==============
HIGHER         ^
\              \* / %
LOWER          \+ \-
============== ==============

The higher the precedence the sooner the value should be evaluated. For
example, in the expression

::

   1 + 2 * 3

``2 * 3`` should be evaluated before ``1 + 2``. This is because
multiplication, division, and remainder have higher precedence than
addition and subtractions.

Associativity
-------------

When parsing expressions associativity determines in what order
operators of the same precedence should be evaluated in. For example:

::

     1 / 2 * 3

In this example both division and multiplication have the same
precedence; associativity determines which operations are evaluated
first. Left associative operations will form a parse tree like this:

|left-assoc-gen|

An example of one of these operations is addition. Lets say we have the
following expression:

::

     1 + 2 + 3 + 4

Because addition is left associative it will form the following parse
tree:

|left-assoc-plus|

An operation in such a parse tree can only be evaluated when all the
operands are leaves. Thus, in this parse tree, the expression ``1 + 2``
is evaluated first and then the result of this evaluation replaces the
subtree for the expression ``1 + 2`` to create the following tree.

|left-assoc-plus-2|

Next, the expression ``3 + 3`` is evaluated, making

|left-assoc-plus-3|

Most operations used in this assignment are left associative, but there
are also operations that are right associative and take this format:

|right-assoc-gen|

An example of a right-associative operation is the exponentiation
operation represented by the symbol ``^``. For example

::

     2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5

should be evaluated as:
:math:`2 ^ {3 ^ {4 ^ {5}}}`

In order for this expression to be evaluated correctly the following
parse tree must be generated

|right-assoc-pow|

For a more complex example consider the expression:

::

   1 + 2 * 3 + 1 / 3 ^ 4 ^ (6 * 3)

which generates the following parse tree:

|assoc-example|
