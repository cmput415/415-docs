      <a id="grading"> <h3 class="greentext">Grading</h3> </a>
      <p>Your assignment grades will be computed as follows: </p>
      <h5 class="greentext">Code Style and Consistency: 15% (10% for Gazprea)
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You should have a consistent style throughout your assignment. For
            example: commenting, variable names, function names, class names,
            file names, indentation, etc… should be consistent in your program.
            You can use tools like clang-format and clang-tidy to support a
            consistent style. When working in teams for VCalc and Gazprea, you
            should discuss style early.</li>
        <li>You are expected to separate class definitions from implementations
            using header (.h) and source (.cpp) files.</li>
        <li>Your code should be clean and readable.</li>
        <li>There is no minimum expectation for commenting or documentation.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="greentext">Software Engineering Process: 5% (Gazprea only)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You should have meetings and record notes. Read more about the
            software engineering requirements
            <a href="engineering/organization.html">here</a>.</li>
        <li>You should follow a consistent process for code reviews.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="greentext">Grammar Implementation: 5% (15% for Generator)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Your grammar should correctly implement the specification.</li>
        <li>Your grammar should have a consistent style.</li>
        <li>Your grammar should be clean and readable.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="greentext">Implementation Guidelines Compliance: 10% (not
                            applicable for Generator)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>You should comply with the implementation guidelines described for
            the assignments.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>SCalc:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>You should comply with the guidelines described
                <a href="https://cmput415.github.io/415-docs/scalc/index.html">
                here</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>VCalc:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>You should write your compiler as a series of passes each with
                simple functionality. Do not implement your compiler as a single
                pass. As a minimun, your compiler should individual passes that
                perform each of the following actions:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an abstract syntax tree.</li>
              <li>Emit LLVM Dialect MLIR.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Gazprea:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>You should write your compiler as a series of passes each with
                simple functionality. Do not implement your compiler as a single
                pass. As a minimun, your compiler should individual passes that
                perform each of the following actions:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Create an abstract syntax tree.</li>
              <li>Define symbols and ensure that symbols can be referenced in
                  the locations they are used. These actions may be performed by
                  two separate passes.</li>
              <li>Propogate type information through expressions and perform
                  static type checking. These actions may be performed by two
                  separate passes.</li>
              <li>Emit LLVM Dialect MLIR.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Your compiler shouild use a symbol table to track symbol
                definitions and scopes.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="greentext">TA Specification Tests: 50%</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>For each assignment, your submission will be tested on a private
            test suite that tests the features defined in the assignment
            specification.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="greentext">Competitive Testing: 20%</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Each submission should include a test suite.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Your submitted tests should be unit-tests. Each test should be
              written to test a particular feature and use a minimal subset of
              the language.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Your competitive testing grade will be determined by a tournament.
            </li>
        <ul>
          <li>In this tournament, submissions earn points based on the
              performance of their submitted compiler and test suite. Each
              submitted compiler will be run on each submitted test suite.
              Consider two distinct submissions, submission-A and submission-B.
              submission-A earns points as follows:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Coherence Points:</b> if compiler-A passes every test in
                test-suite-A, submission-A earns 1 point.</li>
            <li><b>Defensive Points:</b> if compiler-A passes every test in
                test-suite-B, submission-A earns 2 points.</li>
            <li><b>Offensive Points:</b> if compiler-B fails N tests in tests-A,
                submission-A earns N / (number of tests in test-suite-A) points.
                </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Your competitive testing grade is computed by dividing your
              submission’s tournament score by the highest tournament score
              earned by a submission for that assignment in this term. For
              example, if your submission earned 30.0 tournament points and the
              other submissions in the class earned 24.3, 40.0, and 15.9
              tournament points, you will receive a competitive testing grade of
              75%.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In the past, there was a minor penalty for submitting tests that did
            not adhere to the unit-testing practice. So, clever students
            submitted test suites with a few large test cases each including
            many features thus making it more likely that a compiler would fail
            the test cases. Their intent was to offset the penalty with the
            offensive points they earn and the defensive points they prevent
            other students from receiving. To prevent this from happening again
            and to incentivize students to practice writing good unit-tests, the
            TA can exclude tests that they think are not good unit-tests. If the
            TA excludes several tests from a submission and believes that the
            students intentionally created bad unit-tests to abuse competitive
            testing, they may receive a competitive testing grade of 0%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once a week during team assignments and after each submission of a team
         assignment, you must fill out a team assessment. Reach out to the TA if
         your team encounters problems with collaboration that you are unable to
         resolve on your own. Your final individual grade may be lower than your
         team grade by a factor proportional to your contribution to the
         assignment.</p>

      <h3 class="greentext">New in Fall 2020: Fuzzers for Generator, SCalc and VCalc</h3>

      <p>In Fall 2020 <i>fuzzers</i> were added for the Generator, SCalc and VCalc assignments.</p>

      <p>Fuzzers are tools used in a method of software testing called <i>fuzz testing</i>, where a program is fed random inputs in hope of finding software bugs.</p>

      <p>You can essentially view fuzzers as random test-case generators for helping you find bugs in the compilers and interpreters that you create.</p>

      Fuzzers for the Generator, SCalc and VCalc can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/cmput415">CMPUT 415 GitHub</a> or by visiting the <i>Testing</i> sections of the assignment specifications.<br><br>

      Fuzz testing is an active area of research that has broad applications in finding compilers bugs, security vulnerabilities, etc. There are many approaches to fuzz testing; all varying in sophistication.<br>
      In the following readings you will explore two different fuzzers, CSmith and NAUTILUS, which each have their own take on how to approach fuzzing.<br>
